Array2
======

An implementation of Array in JavaScript without ever using a native JavaScript-Array. It has the highly creative title "Array2".

This is just a test, a proof of concept if you will: It's possible to create the complete functionality of a JavaScript-Array without using a native Array. It even works with Function.apply and everything!

## Why should I use that?

No, you shouldn't. It's incredibly slower than a native Array, there's no advantage whatsoever of using Array2.

## What advantage does it have over native Arrays?

What? None! Read the part above. It's just a proof of concept.

## Which Browsers are supported?

I didn't even bother checking for browser support. Look, dude, just don't use it.

## How do I integrate this into my website?

Not at all. This is the result of a few hours of procrastination and curiosity.

## Who in the industry is using this?

You just don't get it, don't you?!
